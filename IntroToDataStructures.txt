How are data structures used?
Data structures handle four main functions for us:

Inputting information
Processing information
Maintaining information
Retrieving information



Algorithms
Simply put, algorithms are instructions that the computer follows to carry out tasks. There are many, many types of algorithms, but some common ones that you will encounter in this course (and likely the world!) are:

Sorting algorithms
Search algorithms
Divide and conquer algorithms
Greedy algorithms
Brute force algorithms
